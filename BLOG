<th><h3>Occasionally, life can be undeniably, <br />impossibly difficult.
        We are faced with challenges <br />and events that can seem overwhelming, 
        life-destroying<br /> to the point where it may be hard to decide whether  <br />
        to keep going. But you always have a choice. <br /> Jessica Heslop shares        
        her powerful, inspiring journey  <br />from the worst times in her life to

   Latest Mood:Life doesn't always give us the joys we want.
<br />We don't always get our hopes and dreams, and we don't <br />
always get our own way.But don't give up hope, because you can <br />make a difference one situation and one person at a time.<br />Look for the beauty around you--in nature, in others,<br /> in yourself--and believe in the love of friends, family, <br />and humankind.
